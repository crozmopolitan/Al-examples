AL Examples for Dynamics NAV 2018
=================================

In this repository you find working examples for various issues.

The examples are described on my blog, look for the tag "AL Coding": https://www.pokorra.de/tag/al-coding/

Installation of a free of charge development setup is described in the first post on that subject: https://www.pokorra.de/2018/07/setting-up-dynamics-nav-2018-for-testing-and-development-in-docker/

You will have to adjust the .vscode/launch.json in each folder, and replace the server with your own url to your docker image.

I hope this is useful to some people, and saves developers the time to find out those things for themselves.

If you want to share some scenarios as well, you are welcome to provide a pull request!
